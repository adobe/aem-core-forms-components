# Component Checklist

**Work in progress:** This page is a tech preview and is being worked on.


## Introduction

The items of the checklist will serve to certify [AEM Components](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/develop/components.html), so that AEM project implementations can compare them and know which ones fit their needs and requirements. This checklist applies to AEM Components that render parts of a page, including their dependencies (Java classes, client libraries, etc.). Exceptions to the checklist are possible, but must be an explicitly listed in the documentation. The components can be built by Adobe or by the community, and a central list of all components will be hosted by Adobe, along with the summary of the checklist completeness.

### 1. Available

Whether the component's code can be accessed and added as dependency on an AEM implementation project.

- [ ] [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or [similar in terms](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a) with corresponding code headers.
- [ ] Discoverable, publicly browseable and downloadable source code.
- [ ] Maven project that can be used as dependency.


### 2. Documented

Whether the capabilities and intended use are described.

- [ ] Description and intended use of the component.
- [ ] List of exceptions to this checklist (possibly with some justification).
- [ ] List of dependencies on back-end and front-end libraries and frameworks.
- [ ] Features and edit/design dialog options (possibly with screenshots).
- [ ] Content structure and properties.
- [ ] Exported APIs and extension points.


### 3. Supported

Whether the documented capabilities are supported by the vendor/author of the component for production usage.

- [ ] Link to contact support for the component.
- [ ] Description of the conditions to get or purchase support.
- [ ] Support for the documented intended use and options.


### 4. Production Ready

Whether the component matches the basic requirements to be used in production for the intended use.


#### 4.i. Secure

- [ ] No known security vulnerability.
- [ ] No hard-coded or stored clear-text passwords.
- [ ] Systematic XSS protection and string/URL encoding (as enforced by Sightly).
- [ ] Outgoing network connections are disabled by default and duly documented.
- [ ] Use service users for background processes (no loginAdministrative).


#### 4.ii. Fast

- [ ] Features that can have a global performance impact or performance bottlenecks are disabled by default and duly documented.
- [ ] Cacheable output (eg. no user-specific data in the response, no query parameters).
- [ ] No JCR queries, no servlet filters, and no custom binding values providers.
- [ ] No server-side event handling without limited scope and explicit documentation.
- [ ] JavaScript and CSS placed in client libraries that can loaded as desired on the page (on top, bottom, or asynchronously).


#### 4.iii. Mobile-friendly

- [ ] Optimized loading of media sizes (images and video).
- [ ] Fluid and responsive layout using the AEM grid.
- [ ] Touch UI component dialogs for edit and design dialogs.


#### 4.iv. Internationalized

- [ ] All publish-side labels are internationalized using the forms i18n library
- [ ] All author-side labels are internationalized through a dictionary.
- [ ] Accounts for variable text lengths.


#### 4.v. Accessible

- [ ] Follows WCAG 2.0 guidelines (eg. component can be used with a keyboard).
- [ ] Extract acessibility related dialog settings to a specific tab.
- [ ] For custom UI components, follows the ARIA and ATAG guidelines.


### 5. Blends In

Whether the component will fit into a project that follows best practice and will not interfere with other elements.


#### 5.i. Compatible

- [ ] Is multi-site friendly: it won't impact other sites, and it's configuration can be site-specific.
- [ ] No assumption on the content structure, configuration or setup of the instance.
- [ ] Is compatible with the AEM page / forms editor features (like Personalization, ContextHub, Layouting mode, Responsive preview, Launches, etc).
- [ ] No page refresh when adding the component to the paragraph system, or when modifying it.
- [ ] No usage of JCR API, of JCR observation, custom node types, or custom JCR namespaces.
- [ ] No hardcoded resource types, paths, groups, etc.
- [ ] Tolerant if the content structure is incorrect or outdated.
- [ ] Namespaced CSS and JS selectors to apply only to the one component.


#### 5.ii. Lean

- [ ] No functionality that isn’t deemed necessary.
- [ ] No abstraction layers that aren’t absolutely necessary.
- [ ] No styles or scripts that are design or site specific (keep them to the bare minimum).


#### 5.iii. Separated concerns

- [ ] No JSP, use Sightly (default choice) or Handlebars (when client & server-side rendering is needed).
- [ ] No HTML or CSS generated from Java or JavaScript code.
- [ ] No styles, scripts, or script events inlined in HTML.
- [ ] No client-side parsing of URL structures.


#### 5.iv. Standard

- [ ] No deprecated APIs.

Follows naming, formatting and coding conventions:

- [ ] Bundles
- [ ] Java
- [ ] JCR
- [ ] URL
- [ ] Sightly/Handlebars (no JSP)
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Logging


### 6. Tested

Whether the component can be verified to perform as expected once installed on a system, and won't suffer from regressions.

- [ ] Unit and/or integration tests
- [ ] Automated functional tests
- [ ] Performance tests
