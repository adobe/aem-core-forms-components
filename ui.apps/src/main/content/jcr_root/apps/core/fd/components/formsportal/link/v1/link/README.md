Forms and Communications Portal Link component written in HTL.

## Features

### Use Object
The Link component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.formsportal.Link` Sling model as its Use-object.

1. `./title`     - Text shown on the link
2. `./tooltip`   - Tooltip on the link
3. `./assetType` - Type of asset the link refers to (e.g *ADAPTIVE_FORM*)

In addition, the n<sup>th</sup> query parameter is saved as `key` and `value` properties on child node `queryParams/item<n>`.
