Search And Lister Component  (v1)
====
Search and Lister component written in HTL.

## Features

### Use Object
The Search and Lister component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.formsportal.SearchAndLister` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Behavior
Pagination is implemented via Load More button, which loads more results lazily.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for the AEM Forms Portal Link component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

## BEM Description
```
BLOCK cmp-searchnlister
    ELEMENT cmp-searchnlister__heading
    ELEMENT cmp-searchnlister__seperator
    BLOCK cmp-searchnlister-search
        ELEMENT cmp-searchnlister-search__box
            MOD cmp-searchnlister-search__box--text
        ELEMENT cmp-searchnlister-search__sortbutton
            MOD cmp-searchnlister-search__sortbutton--wrapper
            MOD cmp-searchnlister-search__sortbutton--right
    BLOCK cmp-searchnlister__results
        ELEMENT cmp-searchnlister__item
            MOD cmp-searchnlister__item--title
    ELEMENT cmp-searchnlister__more
```
## JavaScript Data Attribute Bindings
There can be only one search and lister component in a page currently. It initializes itself with the `searchnlister-onload` event.

A hook attribute from the following should be added to the corresponding element so that the JavaScript is able to target it:

```
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="input"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="filter"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="sort"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="results"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="itemTemplate"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="item"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="itemTitle"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="description"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="formLink"
data-cmp-hook-formssearch="more"
```
