====
Forms and Communications Portal Link component written in HTL.

## Features
Allows adding a hyperlink on a Sites Page to any of the following:
- An Adaptive Form
- A PDF
- An AEM asset
- An external link

User can also specify any query parameters they want in the link during authoring as well.

### Use Object
The Link component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.formsportal.Link` Sling model as its Use-object.

The following properties are written to JCR for the Link component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./title`     - Text shown on the link
2. `./tooltip`   - Tooltip on the link
3. `./accessibiltyLabel` - `aria-label` property on the link
4. `./assetType` - Type of asset the link refers to (e.g *ADAPTIVE_FORM*)
5. `./adaptiveFormPath`, `./pdfPath`, `./otherAssetPath`, `./externalLinkPath` - Path to the asset linked, depending on it's type

In addition, the n<sup>th</sup> query parameter is saved as `key` and `value` properties on child node `queryParams/item<n>`.
