# Runtime-only dependencies

This folder is used for JARs that are not in a Maven repository but are available in AEM at runtime.

## com.adobe.granite.toggle.api

Place `com.adobe.granite.toggle.api-1.2.8.jar` here for compilation. The API is provided by AEM at runtime.

You can obtain the JAR from your AEM SDK installation or from an AEM runtime (e.g. from the relevant bundle in the running instance).
