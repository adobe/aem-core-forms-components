Adaptive Form Number Input (v1)
====
Adaptive Form Number input field component written in HTL.

## Features

* Provides the following type of input:
  * html5 number input
* Custom constraint messages for the above types
* Styles
* Allows replacing this component with other component (as mentioned below).

### Use Object
The Form Text component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.form.NumberInput` Sling Model for its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Form Text component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./jcr:title` - defines the label to use for this field
2. `./hideTitle` - if set to `true`, the label of this field will be hidden
3. `./name` - defines the name of the field, which will be submitted with the form data
4. `./default` - defines the default value of the field
5. `./description` - defines a help message that can be rendered in the field as a hint for the user
6. `./required` - if set to `true`, this field will be marked as required, not allowing the form to be submitted until the field has a value
7. `./requiredMessage` - defines the message displayed as tooltip when submitting the form if the value is left empty
8. `./readOnly` - if set to `true`, the field will be read only
9. `./minimum` - the minimum value that can be entered in this input
10. `./maximum` - the maximum value that can be entered in this input
11. `./minimumMessage` - the message showed to the user if the entered value is less than the minimum value
12. `./maximumMessage` - the message showed to the user if the entered value is more than the maximum value
13. `./leadDigits` - the max no of digits before decimal that can be entered if the type of field is Decimal.
14. `./fracDigits` - the max no of digits after decimal that can be entered if the type of field is Decimal.
15. `./displayFormat` - define the template for display pattern (Reference can be found [here](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Number_Format_Patterns)).

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.forms.components.numberinput.v1.runtime` client library category that contains the Javascript runtime for the component. 
It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property. 
The `core.forms.components.numberinput.v1.runtime` client library also include a widget which helps in implementation of `displayFormat` and `editFormat`.

It also provides a `core.forms.components.numberinput.v1.editor` editor client library category that includes
JavaScript handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.

## BEM Description
```
BLOCK cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__label
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__label-container
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__widget
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__questionmark
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__shortdescription
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__longdescription
```

### Note
By placing the class names `cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__label` and `cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__questionmark` within the `cmp-adaptiveform-numberinput__label-container` class, you create a logical grouping of the label and question mark elements. This approach simplifies the process of maintaining a consistent styling for both elements.

## JavaScript Data Attribute Bindings

The following attributes must be added for the initialization of the number-input component in the form view:
1. `data-cmp-is="adaptiveFormButton"`
2. `data-cmp-adaptiveformcontainer-path="${formstructparser.formContainerPath}"`



The following are optional attributes that can be added to the component in the form view:
1. `data-cmp-valid` having a boolean value to indicate whether the field is currently valid or not
2. `data-cmp-required` having a boolean value to indicate whether the field is currently required or not
3. `data-cmp-readonly` having a boolean value to indicate whether the field is currently readonly or not
4. `data-cmp-active` having a boolean value to indicate whether the field is currently active or not 
5. `data-cmp-visible` having a boolean value to indicate whether the field is currently visible or not
6. `data-cmp-enabled` having a boolean value to indicate whether the field is currently enabled or not
