Adaptive Form Terms and Conditions (v1)
====
Adaptive Form Terms and Components field component written in HTL.

## Features

* It is composed of Text Field, CheckBox and CheckBox Groups
* Allows to author a Terms & Conditions component with either links or Texts.
* Comes with some OOTB behaviour like
  * Approval Checkbox is not enabled if the text-area is scrollable and user has not scrolled to the bottom
  * Approval Checkbox is not enabled if TnC uses Links and user has not visited all the links

### Use Object
The Form Text component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.form.TermsAndConditions` Sling Model for its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Form Text component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./jcr:title` - defines the label to use for this field
2. `./hideTitle` - if set to `true`, the label of this field will be hidden
3. `./name` - defines the name of the field, which will be submitted with the form data
4. `./default` - defines the default value of the field
5. `./description` - defines a help message that can be rendered in the field as a hint for the user
6. `./required` - if set to `true`, this field will be marked as required, not allowing the form to be submitted until the field has a value
7. `./requiredMessage` - defines the message displayed as tooltip when submitting the form if the value is left empty
8. `./readOnly` - if set to `true`, the filed will be read only
9. `./showApprovalOption` - whether to show the approval checkbox or not
10. `./showLink` - whether to show links instead of Text Content
11. `./showAsPopup` - whether to show the TNC content as a Modal

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.forms.components.termsandconditions.v1.runtime` client library category that contains the Javascript runtime for the component.
It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.

It also provides a `core.forms.components.termsandconditions.v1.editor` editor client library category that includes
JavaScript handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.
