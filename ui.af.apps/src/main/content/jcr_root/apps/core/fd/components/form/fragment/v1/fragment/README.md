Adaptive Form Fragment (v1)
====
Adaptive Form Fragment component written in HTL.

## Features
Allow referencing a fragment resource.

### Use Object
The Fragment component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.form.Fragment` Sling Model for its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Fragment component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

#### Fragment Properties
1. `./jcr:title` - defines the label to use for this panel
2. `./name` - defines the name of the panel, which will be submitted with the form data
3. `./fragmentPath` - defines the path of the fragment resource
4. `./bindref` - defines the data binding, and how data will be sent
5. `./visible` - defines initial state of panel visibility
6. `./enabled` - defines initial state of panel if its enabled or not
7. `./tooltip` - defines tooltip on panel title
8. `./description` - defines a help message that can be rendered in the field as a hint for the user

#### Accessibility
1. `./assistPriority` - defines where to pick accessibility information for the Fragment. This can be one of 'Description', 'Title', 'Name', 'Custom' or 'None'
2. `./custom` - defines custom accessibility information for the Fragment, if assistPriority is custom.
3. `./roleAttribute` - defines a role attribute for the Fragment.

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.forms.components.fragment.v1.runtime` client library category that contains the Javascript runtime for the component. 
It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.

It also provides a `core.forms.components.fragment.v1.editor` editor client library category that includes
JavaScript handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.

## BEM Description
```
BLOCK cmp-adaptiveform-fragment
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__label
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__label-container
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__widget
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__questionmark
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__shortdescription
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__longdescription
    ELEMENT cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__errormessage
```

### Note
By placing the class names `cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__label` and `cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__questionmark` within the `cmp-adaptiveform-fragment__label-container` class, you create a logical grouping of the label and question mark elements. This approach simplifies the process of maintaining a consistent styling for both elements.

## JavaScript Data Attribute Bindings

The following attributes must be added for the initialization of the fragment component in the form view:  
 1. `data-cmp-is="adaptiveFormFragment"`
 2. `data-cmp-adaptiveformcontainer-path="${formstructparser.formContainerPath}"`
