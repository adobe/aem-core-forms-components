Adaptive Form Switch (v1)
====
Adaptive Form Switch component written in HTL.

## Features

* Provides the following type of input:
  * switch
* Custom constraint messages for the above types
* Styles

### Use Object
The Form switch component uses the `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.form.Switch` extends `com.adobe.cq.forms.core.components.models.form.CheckBox` Sling Model for its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Form Switch component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./jcr:title` - defines the label to use for this field
2. `./hideTitle` - if set to `true`, the label of this field will be hidden
3. `./name` - defines the name of the field, which will be submitted with the form data
4. `./description` - defines a help message that can be rendered in the field as a hint for the user
5. `./readOnly` - if set to `true`, the filed will be read only
6. `./type` - defines the data type of the value
7. `./enum` - defines the two set of possible values for this field. (On or Off)

## Enum
Switch component can have only one of two state i.e. ON and OFF. Since the enums are stored as array, the enum at index '0' is assumed to be OFF(i.e. switch is 'off'), and enum at index '1' is ON (i.e. switch is 'on'')

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.forms.components.switch.v1.runtime` client library category that contains the Javascript runtime for the component. 
It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.

It also provides a `core.forms.components.switch.v1.editor` editor client library category that includes
JavaScript handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.
